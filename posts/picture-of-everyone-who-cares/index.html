When it comes to choosing between a car and public transportation, the cost of owning a car is often the deciding factor. While both options have their own benefits, a car can be more expensive to own than public transportation. Here are some key factors to consider when making this decision:
-The price of gasoline. The average person spends around $2 per gallon of gasoline on their car, so if you drive an entire month without filling up, your car will most likely require less than $100 in gas each month. On the other hand, parking at a subway or train station costs about $4 for an hour or more.</p><p>-The cost of insurance.

One of the most pressing issues facing our planet is how cars impact the environment. The amount of carbon emitted by a car is equivalent to burning 2400 trees, which is twice the amount of CO2 released in a year from an average coal-fired power plant.1 This means that cars are one of the leading contributors to climate change and their emissions must be reduced if we’re going to save the planet.
There are many ways to reduce the environmental impact of cars. One way is to switch to electric vehicles, which have lower emissions and create less pollution than gasoline or diesel vehicles. Another way is to install public transportation, which eliminates the need for car trips and saves on energy costs. Finally, companies like Tesla Motors are developing innovative new technologies that can help make cars environmentally friendly.</p><h2 id=dodge-sees-electric-future-for-its-performance-cars>Dodge Sees Electric Future For Its Performance Cars<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dodge-sees-electric-future-for-its-performance-cars>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.autonews.com/s3/files/styles/800x600/public/27DODGE-MAIN_i.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.nnUnguho2YhWuqbWMdjsYAHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Dodge sees electric future for its performance cars"><p><em>Source: autonews.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Cars are one of the most popular things in the world.

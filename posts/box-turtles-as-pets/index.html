One of the most pressing issues facing our planet is how cars impact the environment.

There are many ways to reduce the environmental impact of cars. One way is to switch to electric vehicles, which have lower emissions and create less pollution than gasoline or diesel vehicles. Another way is to install public transportation, which eliminates the need for car trips and saves on energy costs.

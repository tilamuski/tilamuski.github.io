Cars have a long and varied history. From ancient civilizations to the present day, cars have been part of human life in some form or another. Some of the earliest cars were built by the Ancient Greeks, and they used barges to transport goods. The first powered cars were created in 1876 by George Stephenson, who designed a machine that could be ridden on rails. By 1907, cars had become commonplace on American streets, and they began to be used for transportation in other countries as well. The first car was built by Ferdinand Porsche in Germany in 1915, and it was the world’s first production car. Today, there are over 200 different types of cars that are sold worldwide.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://tilamuski.github.io/posts/hotbox-cartoon/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Hotbox Cartoon : Volkswagon Van</span></a>

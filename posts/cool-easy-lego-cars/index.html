The costs of car care range from the low to the high. For example, it can cost $10 per month for a car to keep its oil and filters clean, $50 for an air filter, and $100 for a water filter. In addition, it costs money to maintain the car in general—paint, waxing, and detailing are all common expenses. The total cost of keeping a car running smoothly could run as high as $2,000 per year.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://tilamuski.github.io/posts/car-ac-unit/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Car Ac Unit - V Ling: Forest</span></a>

Car is a word that refers to a transportation device that allows people to move about, with the purpose of getting somewhere.
The history and development of cars is reflective of the human condition; both as vehicles for work and pleasure. The first car was created in 1795 by Nicholas-Jacques Conte, an Italian engineer. Carriages had been used by merchants and farmers for transportation for centuries before this.

Here are a few tips to help make the most of your car&rsquo;s drive space:</p><ol><li><p>Make sure you know the dimensions of your car&rsquo;s drive space. This will help you plan where to place things and make sure you have enough room to walk around without having to back up.</p></li><li><p>Place items where they won&rsquo;t block the view or sound of your music or movies. You can place an ashtray in front of the windshield, for example, if you want to watch movies while driving.</p></li><li><p>When parking in a tight spot, remember that there is no need for extra space - just use common sense and put everything else where it won&rsquo;t obstruct the view or interfere with movement.</p></li></ol><h2 id=our-10-most-awarded-cars-of-2020--kelley-blue-book>Our 10 Most Awarded Cars Of 2020 | Kelley Blue Book<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#our-10-most-awarded-cars-of-2020--kelley-blue-book>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://www.kbb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/14-2020-Kia-Telluride-KBB-BB20-1.jpg?w=763" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Qt28C8V273fognbQpfB8_wHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Our 10 Most Awarded Cars of 2020 | Kelley Blue Book"><p><em>Source: kbb.com</em></p><blockquote><p>telluride kbb awarded kelley.</p></blockquote><p>Cars have many different types of parts that make them different from other vehicles.

When it comes to choosing between a car and public transportation, the cost of owning a car is often the deciding factor. While both options have their own benefits, a car can be more expensive to own than public transportation. Here are some key factors to consider when making this decision:
-The price of gasoline. The average person spends around $2 per gallon of gasoline on their car, so if you drive an entire month without filling up, your car will most likely require less than $100 in gas each month. On the other hand, parking at a subway or train station costs about $4 for an hour or more.</p><p>-The cost of insurance. If you want to buy a car that has liability insurance, you&rsquo;ll need to factor in the cost of this type of coverage as well.</p><h2 id=old-german-police-car--photo-by-antranias-public-domain>Old German Police Car | Photo By Antranias, Public Domain<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#old-german-police-car--photo-by-antranias-public-domain>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c9/bb/e1/c9bbe194700b1e08e38b0fd04236a498.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.-b2t5hRuG3oCDq45WLC1LQHaIO&pid=15.1"' alt="Old German police car | Photo by Antranias, public domain"><p><em>Source: pinterest.jp</em></p><blockquote><p>polizeiautos kfz damals einsatzfahrzeuge youngtimer antranias motorräder afbeeldingsresultaat politie needpix oliviabansv autofahren.</p></blockquote><p>Cars are a simple way to get around and they help people do many different things.

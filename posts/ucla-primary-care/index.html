When it comes to choosing between a car and public transportation, the cost of owning a car is often the deciding factor. While both options have their own benefits, a car can be more expensive to own than public transportation. Here are some key factors to consider when making this decision:
-The price of gasoline. The average person spends around $2 per gallon of gasoline on their car, so if you drive an entire month without filling up, your car will most likely require less than $100 in gas each month. On the other hand, parking at a subway or train station costs about $4 for an hour or more.</p><p>-The cost of insurance. If you want to buy a car that has liability insurance, you&rsquo;ll need to factor in the cost of this type of coverage as well.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://tilamuski.github.io/posts/tvc-first-care/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Tvc First Care ~ Aakash Puducherry</span></a>

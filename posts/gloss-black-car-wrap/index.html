People who own cars often find that they need to use them more often than they originally thought. For example, if you work from home and have a car, you might find that you need to take the car to work with you every day. If you don&rsquo;t own a car, but rely on public transportation or a bike, then you may find yourself using your car less and less.
There are many reasons why people might need to use their cars more often. For one, owning a car can be expensive. In addition, if you rely on public transportation or bike transportation for your daily commute, it can be difficult to keep up with the demand for space in your vehicle&rsquo;s storage area.

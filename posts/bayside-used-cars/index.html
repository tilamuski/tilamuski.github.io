First, always drive defensively- if someone is following you too closely, pull over and give them a moment to cool off. You can also try to use common sense when traveling by car- avoid narrow roadways or intersections that are difficult to navigate, and don&rsquo;t speed around curvesunless you&rsquo;re sure of the danger. Finally, be polite when getting around people- try not to honk your horn or make loud noises unless you&rsquo;re absolutely necessary.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://tilamuski.github.io/posts/what-is-a-rotor-on-a-car/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>What Is A Rotor On A Car - Mag0015-jan Rc Car Action Magazine</span></a>

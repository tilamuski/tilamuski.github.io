You can also use your car as an escape vehicle if you need to get away from a situation quickly.\nReduced pollution – Owning a car means you’re responsible for emitting pollutants into the air. This means you can save on emissions costs by driving your own vehicle rather than using harmful gas fumes from other cars.\nThe ability to save money – If you have an extra income, buying a car may be the best choice for you because it gives you access to more affordable transportation options.\nTool Box Hot Wheels Storage | Hot Case Foam Inserts In My Cr… | Flickr Source: flickr.com\n.\nCars have been around for centuries, and they’re still one of the most popular modes of transportation in the world.

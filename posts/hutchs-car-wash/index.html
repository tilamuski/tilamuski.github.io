It is difficult to predict the future of cars because they are constantly changing and evolving. However, some potential future trends that could have a significant impact on car use include:
-Larger majorities of cars will be self-driving by 2030. This will lead to more people being able to travel without ever needing to use a driver.</p><p>-As transportation costs continue to rise, more people will choose to buy or lease vehicles instead of owning one. This trend is likely to continue as the cost of driving becomes too expensive or inconvenient.</p><p>-The number of electric vehicles will continue growing as more people learn about and embrace these types of transportation.

You can also try to use common sense when traveling by car- avoid narrow roadways or intersections that are difficult to navigate, and don&rsquo;t speed around curvesunless you&rsquo;re sure of the danger.

There are four main types of driving experiences: autocrossing, track driving, city driving, and racing. Autocrossing is when you drive in a competition setting to see who can fastest lap the course. Track drivers often race other drivers in races to see who can be the first to reach the finish line. City drivers may take it easy on their way home, while racers may take it all the way to the finish line. Motorsport enthusiasts may also enjoy city driving as a form of racing. Racing is when you use your skills as a driver in order to complete challenges set by others.

According to a study made by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2021, there will be an increase of 3.5 million vehicles on the road in the United States. This means that congestion will become a more common issue, as more and more people are driving to work or other activities. The study found that the number of cars on the road is directly related to the amount of traffic in a city or town. In cities with high levels of traffic, there are more cars and they take up more space on the roads. However, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that everyone who drives in cities is productive; many people drive to escape traffic. In order to ease congestion and protect both drivers and passengers, it&rsquo;s important for municipalities to choose ways to improve traffic flow.</p><h2 id=lower-cape-fear-hospice-mercy-care-in-myrtle-beach-sc-29572--citysearch>Lower Cape Fear Hospice Mercy Care In Myrtle Beach, SC 29572 | Citysearch<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#lower-cape-fear-hospice-mercy-care-in-myrtle-beach-sc-29572--citysearch>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://a.mktgcdn.com/p/3tRAD52qwQIlXs-Dry8PbOtHVZIoHFGTzUv_h0XVKrs/466x466.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tQ3Z-BP1stByWaeHdVYcFwAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Lower Cape Fear Hospice Mercy Care in Myrtle Beach, SC 29572 | Citysearch"><p><em>Source: citysearch.com</em></p><blockquote><p>hospice mercy fear cape lower care myrtle beach.</p></blockquote><p>Uses for cars

According to a study made by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2021, there will be an increase of 3.5 million vehicles on the road in the United States. This means that congestion will become a more common issue, as more and more people are driving to work or other activities. The study found that the number of cars on the road is directly related to the amount of traffic in a city or town. In cities with high levels of traffic, there are more cars and they take up more space on the roads. However, this doesn’t mean that everyone who drives in cities is productive; many people drive to escape traffic. In order to ease congestion and protect both drivers and passengers, it’s important for municipalities to choose ways to improve traffic flow.\n","wordCount":"965","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-02-23T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-02-23T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Me"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://tilamuski.github.io/posts/best-vacuum-for-detailing-cars/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"tilamuski","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://tilamuski.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://tilamuski.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://tilamuski.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://tilamuski.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://tilamuski.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://tilamuski.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://tilamuski.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>Best Vacuum For Detailing Cars - Upholstery Machine Cleaning Cleaner Steam Require Cleaners Finding Offers Research Features Right Type</h1><div class=post-description>How to clean &amp;amp; detail the interior of your car</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-02-23 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 23, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;965 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Me</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#aloha-shine---car-detailing-services---honolulu-hawaii>Aloha Shine - Car Detailing Services - Honolulu, Hawaii</a></li><li><a href=#steam-car-wash-machine--steam-cleaner-for-cars--fortador-usa>Steam Car Wash Machine | Steam Cleaner For Cars | Fortador USA</a></li><li><a href=#best-accessories-for-car-interior---cars-interior>Best Accessories For Car Interior - Cars Interior</a></li><li><a href=#best-car-upholstery-cleaning-machine---steam-cleanery>Best Car Upholstery Cleaning Machine - Steam Cleanery</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-clean-fabric-car-seats---mobile-car-detailing-melbourne>How To Clean Fabric Car Seats - Mobile Car Detailing Melbourne</a></li><li><a href=#5-best-car-vacuum-for-pet-hair-complete-guide-and-reviews>5 Best Car Vacuum For Pet Hair [Complete Guide And Reviews]</a></li><li><a href=#mobile-vacuum-cleaner-machinestainless-steam-car-wash-machine-for-car>Mobile Vacuum Cleaner Machine/Stainless Steam Car Wash Machine For Car</a></li><li><a href=#how-to-clean-amp-detail-the-interior-of-your-car---best-tips-amp-tricks>How To Clean & Detail The Interior Of Your Car - Best Tips & Tricks</a></li><li><a href=#heavenly-clean-auto-detail---mobile-detailing---corsicana-texas>Heavenly Clean Auto Detail - Mobile Detailing - Corsicana, Texas</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Vehicles: What makes a car, and what are the benefits?

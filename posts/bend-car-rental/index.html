There are over 1 billion cars on the road in the United States, and they’re getting larger by the day. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), in 2016 there were more cars on the road than ever before. This increase in number is likely due to a variety of reasons, including an increase in vehicle ownership, faster-growing population, and an increasing need for space.
However, as with most things in life, there are also some risks associated with these cars on the roads. For example, as vehicles get bigger and more expensive, they become more vulnerable to theft or damage. Additionally, larger vehicles can be difficult to navigate around curves or intersections.
